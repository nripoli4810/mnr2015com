        <li class="">Have you picked a name?</li>
        <p class="indent">We have not! We hope to have a few favorites, but won't be naming him until we
          meet
          him!</p>
        <li>Do you have a nursery theme?</li>
        <p class="indent">We do not! We are still in an apartment and will most likely be moving in the
          next year, so we did not choose any themes! However, we are fans of elephants, the original Winnie The Pooh,
          and anything nautical!</p>
